# MintyGuay
 This is a modification of Minty and Minty-Transparent inspired in Budgie Desktop, but with more effects

I recommend to use Window List with App Grouping (Like in the images) and put auto-hide, in panel settings.

It's my first modification of a theme and I do it in one night, so, sorry for the bugs.
