MintyGuay
=============

This is a modification of [Minty](http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/25) and [Minty-Transparent](http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/27) inspired in [Budgie Desktop](https://solus-project.com/budgie/), but with more effects

I recommend to use [Window List with App Grouping]() (Like in the images) and put auto-hide, in panel settings.

It's my first modification of a theme and I do it in one night, so, sorry for the bugs.
